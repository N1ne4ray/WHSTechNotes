The three sensors on Sphero bolt are:
1. matrix sensor
2. compass sensor
3. ambient light sensor
   
The matrix sensor allows you to display an animation on your robot. You can program an animation to occur at any time and stop at any time in your code.
When you have the option to use the matrix animation block, there is a square on the left of the block that you can click. When you click this box you will find
animations that you can use in your code. There is also an option for you to create your own animation that you can use in your code.

How does precision affect the outcome of a program?

Precision affects a program greatly. When you are coding you want to be as accurate as possible. This is so you can have the outcome you want in your code.

What can happen if steps or details are missed in coding?

You want to be as detailed as possible when you're coding. If you miss steps or details in your program, your code may not work the way you want it to. Missing details in your code may also result in an error.

Why is it important to develop good habits of attention to detail early in your coding journey?

It is important to develop good habits; so that your code will be more accurate in the future. If you are constantly inaccurate when you're programming, then youll get used to it. Eventually this will turn into a bad habit and may be hard to stop. This is why it is important to develop the habit of being detailed when coding.

One of my daily tasks in my routine is going on my phone. I use multiple different apps on my phone that each have different functions. Each one of these apps envolves computer science. This is because they each have their own programming to do these tasks. My day would be very different without my phone, since I listen to music a lot.

AI has several benefits, as well as risks.

One of the benefits of AI is productivity. When using AI, we get things done a lot faster. This is because it is reducing the mistakes humans make. AI also makes things more effient, doing things faster than we would. AI is also customizable to our preferences, making the outcome more unique.

One of the risks of AI is unemployment. Since AI can do almost anything, a lot of people are losing their jobs. AI can perform tasks more effiently, with less errors than humans. So, this can cause workplaces to switch entirely to AI. Therefore, unemployment is one major risks of AI.

Computer Science is used in the planning, management, and conduct of elections. One positve impact is being more time effient with the voting process. People can come in, vote on the computer, and their input is saved, making the whole voting process faster.
A concern for technolgy in voting is security. Some voting platforms are vunerable to malware, which can make results unreliable.

It is important to protect your personal information so that people will not steal your information. 
To make sure you protect your information on social platform, look at the settings and turn your account to private. You can also look in your settings and see if that app shares your information with other platforms.
When I was little I used to share my age on Roblox. Now I know that information is not needed to be shared.
To do group online projects, make sure that the project is only shared with those selected friends, and that it is not public.

An event that impacted our community was the presidential election. This event decides who will be the president of our country. Depending on the president, the country will change a certain way. Technology is involved in the election in many ways. The entire voting process involves computers. Voters use computers to input their vote; and the advertisement of the presidents involve technology. Advacements in technology could make the entire voting process faster in the future.

A recent development in AI in large languagge models like Chatgpt. They are programed to process massive amounts of text data, allowing them to produce highly nuanced and contextually relevant responses. This impacts the society by giving more advanced answers, helping people learn more things and work more efficient. This concerns me because people can use the given answers on their work making them look smarter than they are. My field of interest is astronomy and AI can help by using the correct grammar when sharing the found results. Developers need to have some way to shut down the AI in case it backfires, causes more problems.

What "brain rot" means to me is being on social media too much. I think social media has had a negative impact on my well being since it is time consuming. The time I could've spent doing one of my hobbies, I wasted scrolling. "Slop" connects to my experience because i have seen a lot of sloppy things that are AI generated online. It is possible to have meaningful engagement in social media. You can achieve this by managing your time on social media and taking breaks.

Government intervention impacts companies when they see a problem or risk with the company. Then the government can ban or close thethe company. Companies like Tiktok could prevent security problems by listing every thing they have access to. They can also disclose that they do not use personal information. 
A policy I would add is to not use information from other apps. So the only information they would use is the information stored in the app. A lesson I learned is to be cautious when using information. The reason to be cautious is because using information can be percieved as stealing information.

Technology can help aviation safety in many ways. Cybersecurity can help by preventing hackers trying to take control of the plane. If the pilot loses control of the plane than it can be dangerous to the passengers. It can also prevent hackers from jamming signals that can help with communication. Communication is very important in aviation since it prevents crashes so without it can be very dangerous.

Predictive analytics can help aviation as well. With predictive analytics the pilot can know what route to take to the airport. It can also help by showing other flight's routes and helping that plane safety avoid the other plane. Automation can also help planes by autopilot. This saves the pilot's energy during long flights

If I was a software developer for an Nfl team, I would design an app to help the coach execute plans for games. The app would record infomation from the opposing team's previous games. It would record their weaknesses and strengths in different areas. It would also record the players stats and their weaknesses. This would help the team be prepared for any upcoming games. 

 The app takes stats on all players, including yours. Since the app records stats of all players, it will help by knowing what players on your team can help defeat the opposing team. So when the other coach puts specific players on the field, you'd know who to send to win. If you lose a game the app will record the game and find out why you lost. It will give you tips and things to improve before the next game.

Last week, I learned the difference between Greek and Roman theatre. In Greek theatre, tragedies were really popular to honor the god and goddesses. In Roman theatre, comedies were really popular. This is because they were desparate to find entertainment. I learned this in my theatre class, and this was really intresting to me because this occured a very long time ago.

Technology can help with slang in different ways. If someone has used slang while communicating with you, you may not know the meaning. There are websites you can use to look up the word. The website you use will tell you definitions of the word from other users. 

Technology can also help you use slang. You can use AI to help use find out how to use a word you have in mind in a sentence. AI can also help you figure out what word you can use that will apply to your topic. Once you find out your word, AI can give you suggestions of different sentences to use.

I used many different types of technology over spring break. I mainly used streaming and entertainment apps. I would also occasionally play games. These apps include: block blast, Pinterest, Youtube, Youtube tv, and Netflix. I used these apps to watch things like F1 races and different movies.

These apps helped me stay entertained and busy over the break. The technology I can connect to what we learn in this class, are games like block blast. When coding, you need to learn basic problem solving skills. These problem solving skills are used in the game Block Blast.

I do believe the AI prediction in NCAA make the experience thrilling. This is because it gets you excited and gives you a sense of expectancy. If AI predicts the strategy, you can look at the game and try to apply the strategy to it. Now that you can see the strategy, the game seems more interesting.
 Social media and streaming services allows for a deeper fan connection to the game. Streaming services have different things to enable fan interaction like split screen, voting polls, and games. You can now watch two games at once with a split screen and play games by a QR code. You can also vote on different things by a QR code. Things like social media posts can help you prepare for upcoming games by telling you the airing time.

Right now I am mentally, physically, and emotionally tired.The most stressful part of school has been preparing for exams and STAAR. Things I can do to help me is take care of myself, mentally and physically. One goal I have for the year is to better my internal health, and I wil achieve this by eating healthier. Someone I talk to when Im feeling overwhelmed is my mom, I can trust her since she knows me well.

Ai can help you with many things in preparation for test like STAAR. Ai can help you study a specific topic by giving a summary of all the aspects of it. Ai can also prepare you for a test since it can help you curate flashcards or it can give you a quiz on the certain topic. It may help also help you stay organized by giving a list of what to study first.

The best Ai feature for me would be to give a summary of different topics. I would enter in a topic I struggle on or don't remember so I could get better at it. I would use this to refresh my memory on things like formulas and theorms. This would be very useful to me since I tend to be very forgetful.

I think 100 people could win against a gorilla. This is because when in danger people can become creative. When using that creativity people can team up and defeat the gorilla. I think its very irresponsible for this to go viral. People may want to test it out and end up harming themselves. However they may find the answer they were looking for. There is a connection between entertainment and education. When someone watches something for entertainment they might find something they don't know. This is because it provokes curiousity leading to seeking education.

The "Chromebook challenge" is a very dangerous and unethical trend. This trend is unethical because the student is putting themselves, others, and the device at risk. By stick something in the devices port, the student makes the device start smoking and may catch it on fire. Many may take this is just a joke Bit this trend can have serious consequences. 
 
 This trend is dangerous because it may start a school fire, putting themselves and others at risk. By the device catching on fire they are damaging school property and will then have to pay for the chromebook. If the fire grows to be too dangerous they may have to face juvinial charges for setting the school on fire. The student may also get sued if harm is done to other children. A way to prevent this from happening is to put plastic protectors in the chromebooks ports.

I do not feel very happy with the new phone law. It took some time to fully adjust to it since I would use my phone last year.This new phone law makes things very difficult for students and teachers and there are a lot more cons than there are pros. The pros are that it gives students and teachers less distractions and eliminates using AI on school work. The cons are that it takes away contact from parents and family, no more listening to music, no putting reminders in phones, no taking pictures of things teachers need you to remember.

A career I am interested in is an astronomer. Astrononmers research and find things in space. Computer science is used in astronomy a lot. This is because they need high tech systems to be able to study things very far in space. Just to see a distant space object would need very advanced equipment. I know this becuase I have my own telescope at home that was very expensive and it still does not have amazing quality like NASA.

My idea for an AI project would be a trash collecting robot. Littering is a very common thing among people and it poses a very harmful risk. You will see some kind of trash anywhere you go outside. Therefore my idea of trash collecting robots comes into play. These robot can be placed on beaches, in the ocean and common littering areas are. They learn by observing what is trash and what is not, making their job more efficient.

I do not think it is a good idea to work in a virtual store. Working in a virtual store does not pay enough to make a living. It also does not provide valuable job experience.

The number 67 is a common term used among younger people. It's meaning is very unclear and many of the people saying the number do not know the origin of it. The term was made popular by a viral rap song. In the song, the artist pauses and then says 67, emphasizing the number. The term 67 is supposed to be a height, 6 foot and 7 inches. I believe the term 67 came ashore since this is the height of a popular NBA player LaMelo Ball.

If I were in charge of the school I would add a few changes to the phone rules. I would allow student to listen to music in halls and in lunch. I would also allow students to use their phones during passing period and lunches. I would still have AI banned on chromebooks and most games. However I would allow games like coolmath and snake. I think these will make the school better by still letting kids enjoy school while actually learning.

[Mini-Lesson](https://dwarfplanets-raylynj.my.canva.site/)

My prompt was designed to create a detailed interactive mini lesson explaining dwarf planets. I asked to include the dwarf planets from our solar system as well as others and to make the mini lesson clear and understandable for the teen audience. Canva interpreted it as a website that shared facts about each dwarf planet. The interactive parts that worked the best were the clickable descriptions and the quiz at the end. Something I could have improved was clarity on the prompt. I wanted the sit eto share about other solar systems as well, but it was not carried out.

It is a big deal if companies like SNAP run out of funding. If SNAP is running out of funds, this means the company cannot properly function. This is not good since SNAP helps people in need put food on the table. Technology could help by raising awareness, it could get the word out and people could help the company get the funding it needs. However there are challenges that come with this. Not everyone has access to internet or the topic might meet the wrong audience.  I would create a tool to show all people in need places where they can get the things they need.

Drone programmers are very important. They are the reason drones are used for entertainment and theme and amusement parks. Programmers decide which color for each of the drones and in result creating a picture. Progammers also write the code for the drones' navigation to create the moving animation-like visual.

The Waymo violations against school buses are a serious problem. Children getting out of a bus are unpredictable so simply going around and stopped school bus can lead to hittimg a kid. Waymo cars are robotic self driving cars. Since these cars are robotic they can have errors. The cars may not have enough reaction time for when bus lights come on, or they might not recognize the signal they need to stop to. If these are the cases, I would improve reaction times and make sure that the car knows to stop at the bus's signal.
