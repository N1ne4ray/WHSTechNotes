The three sensors on Sphero bolt are:
1. matrix sensor
2. compass sensor
3. ambient light sensor
   
The matrix sensor allows you to display an animation on your robot. You can program an animation to occur at any time and stop at any time in your code.
When you have the option to use the matrix animation block, there is a square on the left of the block that you can click. When you click this box you will find
animations that you can use in your code. There is also an option for you to create your own animation that you can use in your code.

How does precision affect the outcome of a program?

Precision affects a program greatly. When you are coding you want to be as accurate as possible. This is so you can have the outcome you want in your code.

What can happen if steps or details are missed in coding?

You want to be as detailed as possible when you're coding. If you miss steps or details in your program, your code may not work the way you want it to. Missing details in your code may also result in an error.

Why is it important to develop good habits of attention to detail early in your coding journey?

It is important to develop good habits; so that your code will be more accurate in the future. If you are constantly inaccurate when you're programming, then youll get used to it. Eventually this will turn into a bad habit and may be hard to stop. This is why it is important to develop the habit of being detailed when coding.

One of my daily tasks in my routine is going on my phone. I use multiple different apps on my phone that each have different functions. Each one of these apps envolves computer science. This is because they each have their own programming to do these tasks. My day would be very different without my phone, since I listen to music a lot.

AI has several benefits, as well as risks.

One of the benefits of AI is productivity. When using AI, we get things done a lot faster. This is because it is reducing the mistakes humans make. AI also makes things more effient, doing things faster than we would. AI is also customizable to our preferences, making the outcome more unique.

One of the risks of AI is unemployment. Since AI can do almost anything, a lot of people are losing their jobs. AI can perform tasks more effiently, with less errors than humans. So, this can cause workplaces to switch entirely to AI. Therefore, unemployment is one major risks of AI.

Computer Science is used in the planning, management, and conduct of elections. One positve impact is being more time effient with the voting process. People can come in, vote on the computer, and their input is saved, making the whole voting process faster.
A concern for technolgy in voting is security. Some voting platforms are vunerable to malware, which can make results unreliable.

It is important to protect your personal information so that people will not steal your information. 
To make sure you protect your information on social platform, look at the settings and turn your account to private. You can also look in your settings and see if that app shares your information with other platforms.
When I was little I used to share my age on Roblox. Now I know that information is not needed to be shared.
To do group online projects, make sure that the project is only shared with those selected friends, and that it is not public.

An event that impacted our community was the presidential election. This event decides who will be the president of our country. Depending on the president, the country will change a certain way. Technology is involved in the election in many ways. The entire voting process involves computers. Voters use computers to input their vote; and the advertisement of the presidents involve technology. Advacements in technology could make the entire voting process faster in the future.

A recent development in AI in large languagge models like Chatgpt. They are programed to process massive amounts of text data, allowing them to produce highly nuanced and contextually relevant responses. This impacts the society by giving more advanced answers, helping people learn more things and work more efficient. This concerns me because people can use the given answers on their work making them look smarter than they are. My field of interest is astronomy and AI can help by using the correct grammar when sharing the found results. Developers need to have some way to shut down the AI in case it backfires, causes more problems.

What "brain rot" means to me is being on social media too much. I think social media has had a negative impact on my well being since it is time consuming. The time I could've spent doing one of my hobbies, I wasted scrolling. "Slop" connects to my experience because i have seen a lot of sloppy things that are AI generated online. It is possible to have meaningful engagement in social media. You can achieve this by managing your time on social media and taking breaks.

I think these AI tools we limit the workers since the AI is doing most of the work. The workers will have less work to do therefore, limiting them. To prepare myself for this changing job industry, I would look up what postions are avaliable for workers and prepare myself for those positions.

Government intervention impacts companies when they see a problem or risk with the company. Then the government can ban or close thethe company. Companies like Tiktok could prevent security problems by listing every thing they have access to. They can also disclose that they do not use personal information. 
A policy I would add is to not use information from other apps. So the only information they would use is the information stored in the app. A lesson I learned is to be cautious when using information. The reason to be cautious is because using information can be percieved as stealing information.

Technology can help aviation safety in many ways. Cybersecurity can help by preventing hackers trying to take control of the plane. If the pilot loses control of the plane than it can be dangerous to the passengers. It can also prevent hackers from jamming signals that can help with communication. Communication is very important in aviation since it prevents crashes so without it can be very dangerous.

Predictive analytics can help aviation as well. With predictive analytics the pilot can know what route to take to the airport. It can also help by showing other flight's routes and helping that plane safety avoid the other plane. Automation can also help planes by autopilot. This saves the pilot's energy during long flights

If I was a software developer for an Nfl team, I would design an app to help the coach execute plans for games. The app would record infomation from the opposing team's previous games. It would record their weaknesses and strengths in different areas. It would also record the players stats and their weaknesses. This would help the team be prepared for any upcoming games. 

 The app takes stats on all players, including yours. Since the app records stats of all players, it will help by knowing what players on your team can help defeat the opposing team. So when the other coach puts specific players on the field, you'd know who to send to win. If you lose a game the app will record the game and find out why you lost. It will give you tips and things to improve before the next game.

Last week, I learned the difference between Greek and Roman theatre. In Greek theatre, tragedies were really popular to honor the god and goddesses. In Roman theatre, comedies were really popular. This is because they were desparate to find entertainment. I learned this in my theatre class, and this was really intresting to me because this occured a very long time ago.

Technology can help with slang in different ways. If someone has used slang while communicating with you, you may not know the meaning. There are websites you can use to look up the word. The website you use will tell you definitions of the word from other users. 

Technology can also help you use slang. You can use AI to help use find out how to use a word you have in mind in a sentence. AI can also help you figure out what word you can use that will apply to your topic. Once you find out your word, AI can give you suggestions of different sentences to use.

I used many different types of technology over spring break. I mainly used streaming and entertainment apps. I would also occasionally play games. These apps include: block blast, Pinterest, Youtube, Youtube tv, and Netflix. I used these apps to watch things like F1 races and different movies.

These apps helped me stay entertained and busy over the break. The technology I can connect to what we learn in this class, are games like block blast. When coding, you need to learn basic problem solving skills. These problem solving skills are used in the game Block Blast.

I do believe the AI prediction in NCAA make the experience thrilling. This is because it gets you excited and gives you a sense of expectancy. If AI predicts the strategy, you can look at the game and try to apply the strategy to it. Now that you can see the strategy, the game seems more interesting.
 Social media and streaming services allows for a deeper fan connection to the game. Streaming services have different things to enable fan interaction like split screen, voting polls, and games. You can now watch two games at once with a split screen and play games by a QR code. You can also vote on different things by a QR code. Things like social media posts can help you prepare for upcoming games by telling you the airing time.
