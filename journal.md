The three sensors on Sphero bolt are:
1. matrix sensor
2. compass sensor
3. ambient light sensor
   
The matrix sensor allows you to display an animation on your robot. You can program an animation to occur at any time and stop at any time in your code.
When you have the option to use the matrix animation block, there is a square on the left of the block that you can click. When you click this box you will find
animations that you can use in your code. There is also an option for you to create your own animation that you can use in your code.

How does precision affect the outcome of a program?

Precision affects a program greatly. When you are coding you want to be as accurate as possible. This is so you can have the outcome you want in your code.

What can happen if steps or details are missed in coding?

You want to be as detailed as possible when you're coding. If you miss steps or details in your program, your code may not work the way you want it to. Missing details in your code may also result in an error.

Why is it important to develop good habits of attention to detail early in your coding journey?

It is important to develop good habits; so that your code will be more accurate in the future. If you are constantly inaccurate when you're programming, then youll get used to it. Eventually this will turn into a bad habit and may be hard to stop. This is why it is important to develop the habit of being detailed when coding.

One of my daily tasks in my routine is going on my phone. I use multiple different apps on my phone that each have different functions. Each one of these apps envolves computer science. This is because they each have their own programming to do these tasks. My day would be very different without my phone, since I listen to music a lot.

AI has several benefits, as well as risks.

One of the benefits of AI is productivity. When using AI, we get things done a lot faster. This is because it is reducing the mistakes humans make. AI also makes things more effient, doing things faster than we would. AI is also customizable to our preferences, making the outcome more unique.

One of the risks of AI is unemployment. Since AI can do almost anything, a lot of people are losing their jobs. AI can perform tasks more effiently, with less errors than humans. So, this can cause workplaces to switch entirely to AI. Therefore, unemployment is one major risks of AI.

It is important to protect your personal information so that people will not steal your information. 
To make sure you protect your information on social platform, look at the settings and turn your account to private. You can also look in your settings and see if that app shares your information with other platforms.
When I was little I used to share my age on Roblox. Now I know that information is not needed to be shared.
To do group online projects, make sure that the project is only shared with those selected friends, and that it is not public.
