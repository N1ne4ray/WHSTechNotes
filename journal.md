The three sensors on Sphero bolt are:
1. matrix sensor
2. compass sensor
3. ambient light light
The matrix sensor allows you to display an animation on your robot. You can program an animation to occur at any time and stop at any time in your code.
When you have the option to use the matrix animation block, there is a square on the left of the block that you can click. When you click this box you will find
animations that you can use in your code. There is also an option for you to create your own animation that you can use in your code.
